what ARE they??? I don't know exactly...

First let me tell you a lil story:

"hey, all of us trying to learn Machine learning are making our own specific plans for ourselves and not getting anywhere. I ain't ever head of any machine learning milestone made by someone NOT from MIT or Sanford or whatever."

"I've looked at a lot of resources :(. It seems like we have ALL the resources in the WORLD. More than any univerity alone. WHY ARE *WE* (or at least me ;-;) FAILING. WHAT DO THEY HAVE THAT WE DONT???
"Wait a minute... HMMMM... There *iiis oone* thing. Universities don't *just* have resources. They have:"
<h4>STRUCTURE</h4>
"All of the material is scheduled and fit into a course. Of COURSE (ajajajaj pun intended)"
"I need schedules! Due dates for readings and exams and problems!! I nEed it ALL."

and so he ventured off into Open Courseware to find every last resource for the math prerequisites to CS229 (The stanford machine learning course). As a famous hedgehog once said:

>Gotta learn math [if I am to truely understand the concepts crucial to developing machine learning models]

However during his journey, another thought arose in his mind

"What am I gonna do about the ol watching-Youtubes-and-playing-the-vidya-games conundrum. Even when I found a cool machine learning paper I knew I wanted to take a look at, it was always sO EAAAsy to just quick take a look at what the almighty algorhythm has to offer me today, or... <sub>actually tbh I don't really play that many video games anymore I literally just binge watch Youtube everyday</sub>"

(Ok A lot of planning stuff happened so I'll try and be a little more concise here. I wasn't sure whether or not I needed to develop more discipline or try blocking youtube with some software or something. I ended up going to the library with parental controls on my laptop and giving myself freetime when I got home. Maybe the better solution was having a little more self control, but I wasn't sure how to get some so I just went with that. And it worked. The whole Open Courseware plan would've worked aswell if it was complete.......... ;-;-;-;-;;-;-;.)


<h4>As you will sEe hEre in this very paragraph below, the setup was a bit of a hassle and that I'm not even sure if it was at all worth it. Like I could've just went through the material as Open Courseware has it setup and I might've been fine.</h4>
(I tried making a super comprehensive plan that involved all the material you would get in a University course. Some of the Open Courseware courses are missing a few things, like lectures and solutions to exercises, but I found resources on other websites to use as a substitute. The course schedules were a bit of a hassle. I sometimes picked readings from one version, and problem sets from others. Usually the "Scholarly" versions of courses had problems sets don't have as many problems as their original versions. But the calendar for each version is usually slightly different so I had to make sure each problem set covered the readings up to its due date. I printed the readings and exercises so I could more easily see both at the same time. I printed my course schedule's too, for both a checklist and as a way to glance at everything I needed to do that day. I also needed to establish a few boundaries with my family and friends, like I would only have time to hangout on the weekends because I'm trying to study. I worked out a deal with my siblings so I only had to mow the lawn on Sundays if they did the other chores. They hate mowing the lawn.)

<h3>There was a lot of stuff I needed to figure out. Even after I started my "semester" I kept modifying stuff and starting over.</h3>

"Ok, week something day something I got this. Just need to druge through some multivaraible calculus material. Now for some statistics and probability, let's look at the Psets for today................ I don't know this............ I read about these but it was a week ago and I forgot how to solve them........... mY pLaN kEeps fAlling apArt I'm CONSTANTLY finding missing details like notes I forgot to print or a shift in the homework duedates so that it's due a bit sooner than the last reading it covers ;0;"


"I have no idea what makes a successful plan to learn Machine Learning... I have NO idea how to determine whether or not an aspect of a successful Machine Learning Entrepreneur's life is CRUCIAL or <sub>insignificant ;-;</sub>, and I only have so much time in my life to test out different plans................. *screams in agony owo* WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
"Wait a minute... My life.... what about OTHER people's lives :O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O. I'm sure there are others also strUggling to learn this! We can work TOGETHER to come up with a plan! We can use our COMBINED brains to come up with a comprehensive schedule for ALL the resources nessesary to master Machine Learning. We can make it PUBLIC so if it's bad, other people can try and improve upon it. They can develop their OWN versions with their OWN ideas on how to improve it, or even just start from scrATCH!!!!. We'll have a HUGE DATABASE OF EVERY IDEA FOR A PLAN THOUGHT OF IN HISTORY. We'll start off with bAd ones but THEY'LL IMPROVE OFF OF EACHOTHER BECAUSE NOW WE'RE **DOCUMENTING AND SHARING THEM**, and maybe one day,,,,,,,,.,.,.,..,.,. ONE DAY.,..,., One of them will be good..,.,. and when we find that path.,.,., WE'LL ALL RIIIIISE TO THE TOP OF THE MACHINE LEARNING WOOOOORLD"

(And yes, there is no one plan for everyone, BUT ALSO,.,.,.,. A plan doesn't have to be so specific that it can only apply to one individual. I still think it'd be useful to share plans. and hEy, if it doesn't apply to you, create a version that DOES. Maybe it'll help other people in your same bOat. See a super comprehensive thorough Machine Learning plan you REALLY like but could never commit to because of your full time job? Create a version that spreads the material out so you don't have to do as much daily. Idk, stuff like that)
<br><br>
Hmmmm where's a good place to make stuff and then have other people create their own versions of it with minor differences or create their own stuff from scratch. HMMMMMMMM it's Github. People already make guides there!! This is just a more comprehensive guide!!!

K so absorb all that... [here's what RTLs are](https://github.com/BobbertSmithony/RTLs/blob/main/constrUCTION%20zONE%20(drafts)/Explanation%20no.1.md)
