<h3>An RTL is a plAn with thEese keeeey attributes:</h3>
 1. Designed to be applicable to a group of people rather than a specific person<br>
 2. Meant to be sUper experimental (Don't worry if you're not sure of an idea for your plan. trY it, see if people think it's good)<br>
 3. Meant for people to make different verions of<br>
 4. Time-specific<br>
 
<h4>extra:</h4>

I think RTL‚Äôs should be made in Github since it‚Äôd be easy to create different versions and different branches of versions. It‚Äôs designed to handle conflicts between versions too so that‚Äôs pretty nEat. People already make guides on Github. In a way these are just more advanced guides.

‚ÄúEven if you aren‚Äôt interested in this at ALL and just want to get started, it would be helpful to Blog your progress so if you end up doing well, we can learn from what you did and come up with an RTL based on that.‚Äù



<h4>Environment, a crazy complicated wildcard factor.</h4>
When I say environment I mean the google dOht cOm definition:

> ‚Äúthe surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates‚Äù.

So Environment introduces a LOT of potential factors in your RTL, most of which probably don't matter.
It probably doesn‚Äôt matter what clothes you wear when you go to study, or if you had pancakes, waffles, or a salad for breakfast (Well, health and nutrition might be important).
Idk some people think it matters a lot, some don‚Äôt think it matters at all. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. It's up to the RTL maker guy to decide what kind of environment is nessesary or not.

Some might say it's about your character or work ethic, not your environment, and to that I say **your character *IS* PART of your ENVIRONMENT** ü§Øü§Øü§Ø. "What???!? But it's a part of YOU. Environment is stuff OTHER than you!!! How can this bE!!!!!!!". Tell me this, lets say you decide to develop a better character, you now have determinATION, grIT, intEgrity, hOnor, idk all the good stuff. Are you no longer you anymore??? Your character changed, and some might say you've become a different person or that you've chAnged, but you're still YOU. You're just in a different CONDITION. Just to be clear I agree they're both important. Include 7habits in your plan or something. Maybe some other books so they can get multiple perspectives on the matter (although the 7 habits were derived from the behaviors of all sorts of different people so it's already a collection of perspectives. Just saying the more perspectives the better)

<h4>‚ú®RTLs are designed with others in mind‚ú®</h4>
RTLs are designed to be applied to a set of people rather than just for a specific person. It could also be that a RTL only applies to one person on the whole earth THEORETICALLY, but idk i don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs relevant, and i mean like ‚ÄúMy RTL is oNly for people named bOb Bobbothy who live in new JerSey.‚Äù, you could legally change your name to Bob Bobbothy and move to New Jersey or just make a vErsion of that RTL that‚Äôs exactly the same except it leaves out the Bob Bobbothy from New Jersey requirement.

And this would then be the RTL process. Take a goal, consider SMARTER (Consider how specific you want it, how much time it'll take per day, what people this plan is for, etc.), formulate a plan, and publish it on github for people to tweak. Maybe most of the tweaks make it worse and you had a good plan from the start, maybe someone comes up with a super helpful contribution to your plan. That's how I hope it'll go.

We already DO this. When we try to learn we experiment a little on what works and what doesn't. We just don‚Äôt document it for others, so no one ever learns from eachother.
