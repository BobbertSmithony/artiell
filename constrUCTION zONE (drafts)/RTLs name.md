R: Repository, T: Time, L: line j
It's a timeline made in a github repository :I. It'll have all the resources you need to do the stuff in the timeline, um that's part of the repository part. Also it's on github so you can easily make different versions of them.

R: Radical, T: Time, L: line lmao

It's a Radical Timeline. I think most people already use the word timeline for just a loose set of deadlines like "Hey, give me the timeline on that paper" y'know? This is NEW and DIFFERENT and may require a few rAdical lifestyle changes, or not. Anyone can make one. It's up to them to decide how rAdical they want it.

It's a goal with a set of standards . The goal NEEDS to be time specific, as in all material will have some sort of due date. "Ok why not just call it a time-specific goal?" Ya see the thing is with THEEEESE goals, there might be a lot more to them then just "Watch this vid" or "Read this paper". As I've said they're

RADICAAAAL
Here's a few examples of some extrEME changes to your environment that an RTL might have: requiring you to study at a library or someplace quiet, mOre exAMPLES HERE PLEaSE THANK YOUUUUUUUUUU

because SOME aspects of environment MAYBE matter. Every lil change to your environment MIGHT have the potential of improving your performance.

"Ay mr. You sound pretty uncertain of the whole environment thing......... are you sure it he-"
NO IM NOT THATS WHY WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT PLANS TOGETHER. You include however much environmental preparation YOU think is nessesary and maybe people try it and it works who knows maibeeee.

They might ALSO require changes to your relationships with other people or even your very chAracter (both of which can also be considered part of your environment)!!

Examples of character development parts of an RTL idk

Hey, by the end of this plan,,,,,, You might even say you've transfOrmed into a diffent VERSION of yourself. Perhaps someone from another tImElInE WOW YEA THATS WHY I CALL IT THAT WOWOWOWOWOOWWoW. I also watched Loki recently so that may have had an effect on this name choice maybe idk. Basically I'm trying to emphasize the deadlines aspect and the potential lifestyle changes aspect. They're both pretty timeline-y if you ask me. I mean if you don't like it you can just call it RTL and not ever refer to them as timelines. That's probably what I'll end up doing, BUT I THINK THE NAME IS ACCURATE.
