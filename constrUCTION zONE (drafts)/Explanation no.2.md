We have a lot of resources to learn Machine Learning. More than any sole university could provide, and yet most of us struggle... Why???

<h2>Because there's still a few things a University has that the average person doesn't</h2>

<h3>1. Structure</h3>
A plan with deadlines is nessesary, along enough material gathered to develop a sufficient understanding for each concept in a course, like a school would do. People have taken the initiative to develop their own COMPLETE course with deadlines, readings, lectures, exercices, etc. All that you could ask for in a course (Talking about coursera, skilshare, udemy and others). However, these courses seem to be a tiiiny bit basic (I mean I guess I haven't tried every course available on all of those platforms but that has been my impression so far). I STILL RECOMMEND TAKING A FEW to add variety to your learning experience lmao. I mean that way if you don't learn how each method in Calculus was derived, at least you have a decent overview of it.
<h4>The problem with making a super University-worthy comprehensive type course:</h4>
Too mash wurk lmao.
I mean too much work for one person..,..,.,.,.,.,..,.. I mean you can if you want, I personally struggled a lot on it. Read about my trAgic attEmpt at trying to emulate a semester at a university.
<h4>Construct a course schedule with multiple people so it doesn't take forever and you can get different perspectives on the project.</h4>
Ok so we have structure. What ELSE do Universities have that we don't?

<h3>2. A learning environment</h3>
More specifically a place completely separate from the rest of your life where you go to learn. Family and friends from outside school usualy aren't there that'd be weird they have no reason to be at you're school whY. You're expected to work your life around school, in other words life stuff usually doesn't get in the way (and when it does, usually there's people who can help you continue to maintain a good academic standing).

The safe way to get a good learning environment is to try to emulate a school environment as closely as possible. BUT their environment isn't perfect.
It seeeeems to meeee like perhaps maybe from what I've heard, although school is a decent learning environment, it doesn't work for EVERYONE. Having a standard way of learning stuff makes it easy to teach a ton of students, but it comes with the cost of not working for a few people. Maybe try changing up your personal learning environment. Maybe you do fine at home. I go to the library, too many distractions at the house. trY stUff. Try setting up different environments for yourself.

oH nO a prOblem:::::
<h4>Everything you try costs TIME.</h4>

solution::::::::
<h4>ShaRING envIRONMEnt plans like you do course PLANS. BOTH COURSE PLANS AND ENVIRONMENT PLANS.</h4>
You're failed attempts at a good learning envioronment WONT go in vane. People can LEARN from them. You're plan that is SO good at EVERY part except for parts a, b and c can be finished by the rest of the RTL community if you grow wEary of the plAnning.

Your plan and how much material you plan on going through per day might affect your environment as well. SO I SAY a plAN SHOULD COME IN PAIR WITH AN ENVIRONMENT PLAN.

Guess what THAT'S BASICALLY THE IDEA OF AN RTL.

A comprehensive time-specific plan that also includes a plan for your learning environment.

[Here's info on why I named it RTL](https://github.com/BobbertSmithony/RTLs/blob/main/constrUCTION%20zONE%20(drafts)/RTLs%20name.md)
